    "- Frontend: Ensure that all data is properly displayed to user and that users can interact with the data in accessible and easy to interface mechanisms.\n",
    "- Frontend to Backend Integration: Verify that all fetch request (call to algorithm) are working and provide the required data for frontend function.\n",
    "- Backend: Verify user authentication and database - check the ./scripts/db_init.py to ensure all the tables are properly generated with data. Ensure that all tables have proper refrences, and have right data types. Ensure that there are no redundant tables with overlapping data. Add user_authentications to API endpoints when necessary to ensure proper functioning.\n",

    "Key Deployment Terms:\n",
    "- Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): A web service that provides resizable compute in the cloud, allowing users to run various applications on virtual servers.\n",
    "- Docker: A platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers, ensuring consistency across release cycles.\n",
    "- Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running Docker applications. Utilizes a YAML file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes.\n",
    "- Nginx: A high-performance web server and reverse proxy server that directs client requests to the appropriate backend services, enhancing load balancing and scalability.\n",
    "- Route 53: AWS's scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service that translates domain names into IP addresses, routing end-user requests to applications running on AWS or on-premises.\n",
    "- Certbot: A tool for automatically using Let's Encrypt certificates on manually-administrated websites to enable HTTPS.\n",
